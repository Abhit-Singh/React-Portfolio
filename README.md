# React-Portfolio
Being a web developer means being part of a community. I will need a place to share my projects not only to apply for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that I can share my work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

Now that I have completed multiple projects, my task was to create a portfolio, using my new React skills to help set meapart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.
